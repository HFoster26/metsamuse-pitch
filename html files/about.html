           In Finland, the forest is everywhere the most important and diverse natural environment, shaping people, communities, and society. The Finnish Forest Museum Lusto showcases this relationship through exhibitions and aims to share Finlandâ€™s forest culture globally, with the ambition of achieving UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage recognition. Yet what Lusto lacks is direct engagement with the living forest.
The MetsÃ¤Muse project bridges this gap by extending the museum into the Punkaharju research forests, just two kilometers from Lusto. Managed by the Natural Resources Institute of Finland (Luke), the forest hosts more than 100 tree species, including Finlandâ€™s tallest stands. They are not only landscapes of beauty but also living laboratories of biodiversity, climate research, and cultural memory.
At the center of the project is the MetsÃ¤Muse mobile application, which turns forest walks into immersive journeys. Acting as a digital extension of the museum, it offers layered stories, soundscapes, and seasonal prompts that make each tree a point of cultural, ecological, and historical connection. With AI image recognition, visitors can identify species and access knowledge drawn from Lukeâ€™s research and Lustoâ€™s collections. Offline maps and pre-linked data ensure accessibility without requiring users to share their live location.
By blending digital technology with lived forest experiences, MetsÃ¤Muse aims to safeguard Finlandâ€™s forest culture as intangible heritage and advances Lustoâ€™s pathway to UNESCO recognition.
